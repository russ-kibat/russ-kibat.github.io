      <h1><a href="/neural-networks/">Creating a Niche Classifier with Neural Networks</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The wedding industry consists of many independent designers, artists, and planners who are responsible for every aspect of their businesses. An important aspect of their marketing efforts takes place on social media platforms like Instagram. Over time, they develop large libraries of pictures that are the core of marketing efforts. These pictures come unlabeled and a great amount and it takes a great amount of time to search through them to select images for posts. Selecting photos for marketing takes valuable time away from spending time working with their clients. Computer vision techniques using neural networks offer a solution to this problem: using established image classification neural network models can I employ transfer learning to fine tune a model to create a niche classifier to classify wedding images on a small dataset?</p>

      <h1><a href="/Hotel-Review-1/">Hotel Review Analysis Using NLP Part 1</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Customer reviews are vital in understanding how a company can focus its attention on maintaining and growing its customer base. This is especially important in the hospitality industry where customers’ brand loyalty relies on consistent, positive experiences for frequent travelers. Text data is time consuming to process and it can be difficult to get an understanding of subtle trends in the data without cross checking reviews to see if keywords are predictive of an overall rating. To aid this effort I am going to analyze customer feedback from an internationally operating hotel company. My goal is to build a model that can predict an overall positive or negative rating, based on common keywords in reviews. Once a reliable model has been developed I can deliver the keywords to company management responsible for improving customer experience. These insights will inform them as to what the hotels are doing well and where they can improve.</p>
